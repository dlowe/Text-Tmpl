========

This directory contains three simple programs.  These programs all do
exactly the same thing, but they are implemented in C, C++ and Perl,
respectively.  There is also a template, and a sample Makefile with which
you can (possibly with some modifications) build the applications.  You
will need to build libtmpl.a in the parent directory (make libtmpl.a) before
you can do so.

Eventually I hope to add some interesting and/or useful example applications
here, as well as at least some test code for the C and C++ language support.

Everything in this directory is not officially supported, and it will almost
certainly take a little tweaking to get it to work on your system.
