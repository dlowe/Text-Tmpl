Description
===========

Text::Tmpl is a module for very fast templating. There are dozens of
templating modules on CPAN, each only a tiny bit different from the
others. This one is no different - what sets it aside is speed. The
entire module is implemented as a C library, with only a thin XS/Perl
layer to make the calls available from Perl. The same templates, then,
can be used from either Perl or C/C++ programs.

This was originally designed to completely isolate HTML programmers
from module/CGI programmers, or at least completely separate logic
from content in dynamic web applications. It is syntactically based on
a similar system written by a friend of mine, Neil Mix, which was
proprietary and exclusively written in Perl. It shares no code in
common with this system, or any other.


Prerequisites
=============

A C compiler and Perl 5.  Unix (and derivative) and Win32 systems are supported
as of 0.24.


Building
========

  # perl Makefile.PL
  # make


Installing
==========

  # make test
  # make install

The C library version is not built or installed by default.  If you want to
use it, you can build install it by hand.  Something like this ought to work:

  # ar cr libtmpl.a context.o default_tags.o nclist.o parser.o staglist.o \
          tagplist.o template.o varlist.o tokens.o
  # ranlib libtmpl.a
  # cp libtmpl.a /usr/local/lib
  # cp *.h /usr/local/include

This is only intended as a guide; it may very well require modification for
use on your system.


Additional Information
======================

If you're using this module, let me know!  It's always fascinating to hear
what uses people have found for it.

There's a lot of example perl code in the t/ (test scripts) directory in
this distribution.  There's also a little bit of example C and C++ code in
the examples/ directory of the distribution.

You can contact me directly at dlowe@saturn5.com.  I'm happy to answer any
questions you might have.

If there's enough demand, I will create a mailing list for discussion/support.
Let me know if this interests you.
